## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

The prime goal of doing this project was to get my hands dirty with fetch API. It is a nice starter project to get started with APIs. I also decided to built this project using Tailwind CSS so as to recap some tailwind CSS as well.

Fetching data from an API using javascript's Fetch API:

```js
fetch(URL)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Continued development

With this project I got my self started with fetch API. I am looking forward to do some projects regarding APIs so as to get a strong grip on the API concepts.

### Useful resources

I would highly recommend [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), if someone is looking forward to start learning web development or get their concepts clearer and stronger. It has everything, one would want to learn, the most trustworthy resource out there!

If one finds it difficult to read the docs, they can watch video tutorials on youtube and then can read about the same on mdn.

- [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - This really helped me in understanding how to fetch the data using Fetch API.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) - You can get started with tailwind css by using the play-cdn. Just follow the steps mentioned, and you can start using the tailwind css then. Having trouble with any property ? there is a search button, where we can search for a particular CSS property, read through it and customize it as well. They really have a very nice documentation!
